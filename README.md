# draje
Dracula Jekyll Theme

## Example
This is what [my current website](https://confest.im) is currently running. Here's a [full example](https://confest.im/posts/how-this-works/) and guide as to how this works.

You can also see a barebones github pages instance (literally just turned it on throught the GH settings) [here](https://confestim.github.io/draje). Some links might be broken if not deployed on root (i.e. website not running on domain.tld/). That is somewhat intended.
